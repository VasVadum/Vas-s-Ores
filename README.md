I created this mod in order to change what you refine out of each thing you mine.
A 1:1 ratio of mass is returned. This also disables a yield module so that you can't 
gain more than 1:1 mass illogically.

In short, when you mine 1 kilogram of stone, you'll get 0.9 kilograms of gravel, 
0.1 kilograms of other stuff.
